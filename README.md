## Hewlett Packard Enterprise Software Engineering Job Simulation
**HewlettPackard-Enterprise_SoftwareEngineer:** <br>
I completed the Hewlett Packard Enterprise Software Engineering job simulation on Forage, where I developed a RESTful web service using Java Spring Boot to manage employee data. I built a web server, handled HTTP requests, and implemented unit tests using JUnit and Mockito. This experience strengthened my back-end development skills..

**Repository Overview:**  
This repository documents my experience in the **Hewlett Packard Enterprise Software Engineering Virtual Experience** on the Forage platform. The simulation allowed me to take on the role of a **back-end engineer** where I was tasked with developing a **RESTful web service** to manage employee data using **Java Spring Boot** and **JUnit** for unit testing. This simulation gave me valuable hands-on experience in building, testing, and optimizing a web server application in a real-world context.

**Simulation Highlights:**

1. **Developing a RESTful Web Service**  
   - Wrote a proposal for a **RESTful web service** to manage a list of employees, outlining how the service would handle HTTP requests and interact with employee data.

2. **Building a Web Server Application**  
   - Developed a **Java Spring Boot** application that accepts and responds to **HTTP requests**. The web server supports **uploading JSON data** to interact with employee records.

3. **Unit Testing with JUnit and Mockito**  
   - Designed and implemented **unit tests** to assess the performance and functionality of the Java Spring Boot application. Used **JUnit** and **Mockito** for testing and validating the code to ensure reliability and robustness.

**Skills Demonstrated:**
- **Java and Java Spring Boot**: Gained proficiency in **Java Spring Boot** for building scalable and secure back-end web applications that handle **HTTP requests** and interact with **JSON data**.
- **RESTful Web Development**: Designed and developed a **RESTful web service** that communicates through HTTP protocols to manage and manipulate employee data.
- **Unit Testing**: Implemented **unit tests** using **JUnit** and **Mockito**, ensuring the reliability of the application and helping identify and resolve potential issues in the codebase.
- **Communication and Proposal Writing**: Developed communication skills by writing a detailed proposal for the **RESTful web service** and explaining how it would manage employee data through HTTP requests.

**Skills Developed:**
- **Back-End Development**: Strengthened my understanding and practical experience of building back-end applications using **Java Spring Boot**.
- **Web Service Design**: Enhanced my ability to design and implement **RESTful web services** that adhere to industry standards for communication and data management.
- **Software Testing**: Improved my knowledge of **unit testing** methodologies with **JUnit** and **Mockito**, ensuring the accuracy and functionality of software systems.
- **Cloud Integration**: Familiarized myself with **GreenLake Cloud Platform** and how to integrate web services with cloud-based platforms to support scalable applications.

**Objective:**  
This repository highlights the tasks and skills I developed during the **Hewlett Packard Enterprise Software Engineering Job Simulation**. The experience confirmed my passion for **back-end development** and working on **Java Spring Boot** applications. I am eager to apply what Iâ€™ve learned in a software engineering team at **Hewlett Packard Enterprise** or any organization focused on back-end development and building scalable web applications.
