# HewlettPackard-Enterprise_SoftwareEngineer
I completed the Hewlett Packard Enterprise Software Engineering job simulation on Forage, where I developed a RESTful web service using Java Spring Boot to manage employee data. I built a web server, handled HTTP requests, and implemented unit tests using JUnit and Mockito. This experience strengthened my back-end development skills.
